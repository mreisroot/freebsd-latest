# A script to get the latest packages on FreeBSD

This is just a script I wrote to automate the tasks described on [Topic "4.4.2 Quartely and Latest Ports Branches" of the FreeBSD Handbook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/ports/#pkgng-intro), in order to get the latest package updates.

If you're interested to get my suckless FreeBSD setup using the [suckless-freebsd project](https://gitlab.com/mreisroot/suckless-freebsd), I highly recommend that you run the [this project's script](./suckless-freebsd.sh) first, because, for example, yt-dlp needs to be at the latest version to work well with the mpv media player and pipe-viewer command line youtube video searcher.
